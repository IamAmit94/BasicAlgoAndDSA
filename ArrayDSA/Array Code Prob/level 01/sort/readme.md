# Popular Sorting Algorithms:

1. `Bubble Sort`: Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large arrays as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

2. `Selection Sort`: Selection sort is another sorting technique in which we find the minimum element in every iteration and place it in the array beginning from the first index. Thus, a selection sort also gets divided into a sorted and unsorted subarray.

3. `Insertion Sort`: Insertion sort similarly to the way we sort playing cards in our hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed in the correct position in the sorted part.

4. `Merge Sort`: It is a sorting algorithm that is based on the Divide and Conquer paradigm. In this algorithm, the array is repeatedly divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.

5. `Quick Sort`: This is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer approach where an array is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot element (element selected from the array).

6. `Heap Sort`: Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to the selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. Repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

7. `Counting Sort`: Counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. It works by counting the number of elements having distinct key values (kind of hashing). Then do some arithmetic to calculate the position of each element in the output sequence.
