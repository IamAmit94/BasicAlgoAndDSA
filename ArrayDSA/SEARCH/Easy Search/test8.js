// Check for Majority Element in a sorted array


/**
Given an array arr of N elements,  A majority element in an array arr of size N is an element that appears more than N/2 times in the array. The task is to write a function say isMajority() that takes an array (arr[] ), arrayâ€™s size (n) and a number to be searched (x) as parameters and returns true if x is a majority element (present more than n/2 times).

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10}, x = 3
Output: True (x appears more than n/2 times in the given array)

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6}, x = 4
Output: False (x doesn't appear more than n/2 times in the given array)

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 2, 2}, x = 1
Output: True (x appears more than n/2 times in the given array)
