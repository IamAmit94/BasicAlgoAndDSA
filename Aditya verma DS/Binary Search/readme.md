CONCEPT Binary Search on Answer

The "Binary Search on Answer" or "Binary Search on Result" concept is a technique used in problem-solving, especially in optimization problems, where you have to find a specific value that satisfies certain conditions. Instead of searching for the actual solution directly, you perform binary search on the possible range of solutions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. Define the Search Space:
Identify the range or space where the answer lies. This could be a range of possible values or solutions.

2. Perform Binary Search:
Apply binary search on the defined search space.

3. Check the Condition:
At each step of the binary search, check whether the current mid-point satisfies the condition you are looking for.

4. Adjust the Search Space:
Based on the condition, adjust the search space to continue the binary search. If the condition is met, move towards the left side of the search space; otherwise, move towards the right side.

5. Termination:
Continue the binary search until you narrow down the search space to a single point, which represents the desired solution.

This concept is particularly useful when the problem has a monotonic property, meaning that the condition you are checking has a consistent behavior (either always true or always false) over a certain range of values.
