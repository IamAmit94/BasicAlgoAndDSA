# Revoing the duplicate element from the array

`Best Overall Approach`: Using a `Set` is the most efficient and simplest method if you only need to remove duplicates.

`Best for Counting Duplicates`: Using a `Map or Frequency Counter` is best if you need to count occurrences or find specific duplicates.

`Best for Educational Purposes`: Using `filter and indexOf` helps understand basic array operations but is not the most efficient.
