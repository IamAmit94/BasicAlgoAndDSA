# FIXED SIZE WINDOW
1. max/min sub array of size k
2. Ist -ve in every window size of k
3. 1 st +ve in every window size of k
4. count occurence of anagram
5. max/min of all subarray of size k
6. max/min for every window size


# VARIABLE 
1. longest/smallest subarray of sum k
2. larger substring of k distinct character
3. length of largest substring with no reapiting character
4. pick toy  ||
